# Idea:
The database is to query from the dataset of ```Council_Member_Expenses.csv```, which was obtained from [City of Winnipeg Open Data Portal](https://data.winnipeg.ca/)
<br>
The definition of the database is:
- There are 3 entities: ```Expense```, `Councilor` and `Ward`. ```Expense``` is a weak entity. 
- One to many from ```Councilor``` to ```Expense```.
- One to many from ```Ward``` to ```Councilor```.
- Each ```Expense``` must belong to one ```Councilor```, but not every ```Councilor``` has an ```Expense```.
- Not every ```Councilor``` has one ```Ward```, and not every ```Ward``` has a ```Councilor```.
<br>

# Valid queries:
1. print the names and IDs of all the known wards.
2. print all the expenses, with associated ward and councilor name.
3. Print the names of all councilors.
4. Print total expenses for a specified councilor.
5. Print total expenses for a specified ward.
6. Delete a councilor by 'name'.
7. Delete an Expense by 'id'.
8. Show the highest single‚Äêtime expense for each councilor.

# How to run:

Step 1: Clone or download the project.
<br>
Step 2: Open the folder in IntelliJ IDEA
<br>
Step 3: Run ```src/Main.java```
<br>
Step 4: Enter commands in the console.
